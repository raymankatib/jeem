			},
			{
				"question": "Do I need to be in a specific location?",
				"answer": "No. We're remote-friendly and work with talent globally. However, some projects may have timezone preferences (usually requiring 4+ hours overlap with US/EU times)."
			},
			{
				"question": "What's the English requirement?",
				"answer": "You need to communicate clearly in written English. Most client interactions are async, so strong writing matters. If you can read and respond to this page comfortably, you're likely fine."
			},
			{
				"question": "How does payment work?",
				"answer": "Most likely by cash. Rates are agreed upfront before any project starts. We don't take cuts from your pay — our fee is on the client side."
			},
			{
				"question": "What timezones do you work with?",
				"answer": "All of them. That said, most of our clients are in US and EU timezones. We'll share timezone expectations for each opportunity so you can decide if it fits your schedule."
			},
			{
				"question": "What does the screening process look like?",
				"answer": "We review your application and portfolio. If there's a potential fit, we'll schedule a 20-30 minute call to learn more about you. We're looking for proof of quality work and good communication."
			},
			{
				"question": "How long does matching take?",
				"answer": "It varies. Some people get matched within days, others within weeks. It depends on your skills, availability, and what projects we have coming in. We won't spam you with irrelevant opportunities."
			},
			{
				"question": "Can I apply for multiple roles?",
				"answer": "Yes, but pick your strongest. We'd rather see you excel in one area than be mediocre across many. You can mention secondary skills in your application."
			},
			{
				"question": "What if I'm currently employed full-time?",
				"answer": "That's fine. Many of our talent work part-time or on weekends. Just be clear about your availability so we can match you with appropriate projects."
			},
			{
				"question": "Is there a fee to join?",
				"answer": "No. It's free to apply and be part of the network. We make money when we place you with clients, and that fee comes from the client, not you."

				{
					"question": "How much does it cost to hire through Jeem?",
					"answer": "Pricing depends on the engagement type. For long-term roles, we typically charge a placement fee. For project-based work, the fee is built into the rate. You’ll always see pricing upfront — no surprises."
				},
				{
					"question": "How quickly can I get matched with candidates?",
					"answer": "Within 48 hours of submitting your requirements, we’ll send 2–3 pre-vetted candidates. Many teams complete a hire within 5 days."
				},
				{
					"question": "What if the hire doesn’t work out?",
					"answer": "Every placement includes a 2-week trial. If it’s not a fit, we’ll replace them at no additional cost."
				},
				{
					"question": "Can I hire for multiple roles at once?",
					"answer": "Yes. Many clients hire multiple roles in parallel, and some build entire teams through Jeem."
				},
				{
					"question": "How is Jeem different from traditional recruiters?",
					"answer": "You only meet vetted candidates. It’s faster (48h matches), more hands-on, and we stay involved after the hire to ensure success."
				},
				{
					"question": "Are your talent remote or on-site?",
					"answer": "Jeem is remote-first. We match for timezone overlap with North America and Europe, and can source for specific coverage when needed."
				},
				{
					"question": "How do you vet talent?",
					"answer": "Portfolio review, references, and communication assessment. For technical roles, we also validate the work through code review or skill verification."
				},
				{
					"question": "Can we try someone on a project before committing long-term?",
					"answer": "Yes — “try before hire” is common. Start with a scoped project, then convert to ongoing if it’s a strong fit."
