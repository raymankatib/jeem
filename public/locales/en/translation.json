			},
			{
				"question": "Do I need to be in a specific location?",
				"answer": "No. We're remote-friendly and work with talent globally. However, some projects may have timezone preferences (usually requiring 4+ hours overlap with US/EU times)."
			},
			{
				"question": "What's the English requirement?",
				"answer": "You need to communicate clearly in written English. Most client interactions are async, so strong writing matters. If you can read and respond to this page comfortably, you're likely fine."
			},
			{
				"question": "How does payment work?",
				"answer": "You're paid in USD, typically via bank transfer or Wise. Rates are agreed upfront before any project starts. We don't take cuts from your pay — our fee is on the client side."
			},
			{
				"question": "What timezones do you work with?",
				"answer": "All of them. That said, most of our clients are in US and EU timezones. We'll share timezone expectations for each opportunity so you can decide if it fits your schedule."
			},
			{
				"question": "What does the screening process look like?",
				"answer": "We review your application and portfolio. If there's a potential fit, we'll schedule a 20-30 minute call to learn more about you. We're looking for proof of quality work and good communication."
			},
			{
				"question": "How long does matching take?",
				"answer": "It varies. Some people get matched within days, others within weeks. It depends on your skills, availability, and what projects we have coming in. We won't spam you with irrelevant opportunities."
			},
			{
				"question": "Can I apply for multiple roles?",
				"answer": "Yes, but pick your strongest. We'd rather see you excel in one area than be mediocre across many. You can mention secondary skills in your application."
			},
			{
				"question": "What if I'm currently employed full-time?",
				"answer": "That's fine. Many of our talent work part-time or on weekends. Just be clear about your availability so we can match you with appropriate projects."
			},
			{
				"question": "Is there a fee to join?",
				"answer": "No. It's free to apply and be part of the network. We make money when we place you with clients, and that fee comes from the client, not you."
